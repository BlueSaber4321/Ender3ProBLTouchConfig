# Ender3ProBLTouchConfig
Configuration files for Ender 3 Pro BLTouch running Marlin.
These config files were modified from the stock Ender 3 Pro Marlin Configuration for the BLTouch Kit sold by Creality. I didnt make the original configuration, I just modified it. Any changes I make will be reuploaded.

## Notice:
**I am not responsible for any damage done to your printer/firmware.** PLEASE VERIFY THE CONFIGURATION FILES BEFORE YOU BUILD MARLIN.

These configurations are for the **Ender 3 Pro with the Creality BLTouch Add-On Kit**. If you have added on a BLTouch that isnt the official kit, be sure to modify your probe offsets to prevent your probe from going off the bed.
